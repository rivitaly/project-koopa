    doubt who I have intended this for.  I am the Keeper, and you are Corvus; my
    son.  You see, I felt you needed to be raised in a more homely environment with
    friends and neighbors before discovering your truth - that you possess the same
    will, power and strength as do I; as a Keeper.  I hope that you will find it
    within yourself to continue protecting those who cannot protect themselves as
    I have." - Keeper'
